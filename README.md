# Discord-Dice-Roller  
  
Requires NodeJS  
You will need to create your config.json file with your Discord token in it.  
i.e.  
{  
"token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE"  
}  
  
Run with command line arguements to determine which dice rolling rules it should use.  
"DND" - Dungeons and Dragons, uses pretty generic rolling and can be used for other systems.  
"VTM" - Vampire the Masquerade Anniversary Edition  
"L5R" - Legend of the Five Rings  
"12" - This is a homebrew game, you can ignore it  

The bot uses "/r" as the identifier  
An example command would look like this: "/r 1d20 + 5"
